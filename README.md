## Introduction

This is a small app meant to use the GHC API to translate a `.hs` file
into STG (and eventually C--).  It is compiled against GHC HEAD,
commit d99fc2508204c59cfc83d8a68718cf930ccc74b2.

## Issue

The app builds, but when running, it panics.

I tried a very similar app compiled against the 9.0Â API.
Some function calls had to be changed, but the 9.0 version dumped out
STG code in the style of `-ddump-stg`, as expected.

Here's evidence of failure:

sandbox: panic! (the 'impossible' happened)
  GHC version 9.3.20210918:
        unsafeGetHomeUnit: No home unit

Please report this as a GHC bug:  https://www.haskell.org/ghc/reportabug
```

A cursory investigation suggests that the home unit would have been
set by `setSessionDynFlags`.  So I'm confused.
